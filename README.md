waterfront - A categorical variable for whether the apartment was overlooking the waterfront or not.

view - An index from 0 to 4 of how good the view of the property was.

condition - An index from 1 to 5 on the condition of the House.

grade - An index from 1 to 13, where 1-3 falls short of building construction and design, 7 has an average level of construction and design, and 11-13 have a high quality level of construction and design.

sqft_above - The square footage of the interior housing space that is above ground level.

sqft_basement - The square footage of the interior housing space that is below ground level.

yr_built - The year the house was initially built

yr_renovated - The year of the houseâ€™s last renovation

zipcode - What zipcode area the house is located in

lat - Lattitude

long - Longitude

sqft_living15 - The square foot area of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors

sqft_lot15 - The square foot area of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors
